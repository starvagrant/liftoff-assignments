# Project Planning
For this assignment, you'll create some initial plans for your project.

### Wireframes

I having agreed to try a command line program, so wireframes took some imagination.

I tried to map:
- The command's proposed syntax [Kvm Syntax](photos/kvm-syntax-tree.jpg)
- Ideas for making the program more user friendly for staff[User Feedback](Photos/kvm-user-feedback.jpg)
- What messages the command might make for clients who use the remote connections[Client Messages](Photos/kvm-client-message.jpg)
